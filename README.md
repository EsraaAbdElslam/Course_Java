(The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a
class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person has a name,
address, phone number, and email address. A student has a class status (freshman,
sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant. An employee has an
office, salary, and date hired. Define a class named MyDate that contains the fields
year, month, and day. A faculty member has office hours and a rank. A staff
member has a title. Override the toString method in each class to display the
class name and the personâ€™s name.


Draw the UML diagram for the classes. Implement the classes. Write a test program
that creates a Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff, and
invokes their toString() methods.
