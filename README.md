(Game: displaying a TicTacToe board) Display a frame that contains nine
labels. A label may display an image icon for X, an image icon for O, or nothing,
as shown in Figure 12.15(c). What to display is randomly decided. Use the
Math.random() method to generate an integer 0, 1, or 2, which corresponds to
displaying a cross image icon, a not image icon, or nothing. The cross and not
images are in the files x.gif and o.gif, which are under the image directory
in www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/intro8e/book.zip).
